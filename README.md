# ALX Webpage-to-README Converter

This Python script is designed to simplify the process of converting webpages of school projects into formatted README files for easier documentation. Instead of manually writing READMEs from scratch, you can download the webpage of the project as an HTML file into a suitable folder and run this script, which will process the HTML file and produce a formatted README with the same information.

## Usage

1. **Download HTML File**: Save the webpage of your school project as an HTML file in a suitable folder.

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the `main.py` script provided in this repository. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input HTML File Path**: When prompted, enter the path to the HTML file you downloaded in step 1.

4. **Generate README**: The script will process the HTML file and generate a formatted README.md file in the same folder.

## Script Details

- The script utilizes the BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML content and extract relevant information.
